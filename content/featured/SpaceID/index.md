Space ID is a Web3 digital identity and domain name platform that makes it easy to manage human-readable names across multiple blockchains instead of long hexadecimal wallet addresses. It acts like a decentralized, multi-chain name service, letting users search for, register, trade, and manage web3 domains from one place. Developers can also integrate its Web3 Name SDK & API into their apps to resolve and use these names on different chains.
